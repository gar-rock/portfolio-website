## How To Customize

Each page consists of two images. 
The first loads at the top of the page inside the header.
The second loads inside the section2 div

As you scroll down there is a parallax effect with a middle div called section2


You can change the two images via the styles at the top of each page, and the colors for your nav items and text items

## TODO
- incorporate a config file with image1 and image2 names and easy color customization, along with a script to render all of the HTML pages
- provide the terraform files for deploying via cloudfront, S3, Route53
